### Context:
The company wishes to build a system beyond selling computers that will provide additional services to help buyers customize their computer configuration based on their preferences and financial situation, providing a more flexible shopping experience. Customers can build their own PCs without relying on the assistance or advice of staff.

### Problem:
Choosing computer components or building a complete and cost-effective PC can be difficult for beginners. They often have to seek advice or do not know whether the components are compatible or not. The current process of buying a computer at the store is complicated, and many customers do not have much time to choose a computer. Customers may hesitate to ask for direct advice if they do not intend to buy regarding the detailed specifications of the computer and the price.

### Proposed Solution:
Develop a platform to facilitate buying and building suitable and easy-to-use PCs.
